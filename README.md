# Steganography-Software

Images can be a great way to store hidden messages. We are faced with hundreds, if not thousands, of images every day, and potentially each of them may contain some kind of hidden message. The interesting point is that we cannot visually detect whether an image contains a message or not, because they are altered in such a way that our eyes will not be able to notice it.

So we built this steganography software for a computer vision university project, that enables you to encrypt a text as an 8-bit image in a 16-bit image and also decrypt them using the concept of least significant bit technique.
